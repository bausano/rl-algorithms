# Reinforcement learning algorithms
Collection of reinforcement learning algorithms and/or programs that I
implemented to practice the ideas of RL.

I implement them as they come in [David Silver's classes][david-silver-website]
on RL (the recordings are available on [YouTube][david-silver-rl-yt]) or in
a [text book by Sutton and Barto, Reinforcement Learning:An Introduction][sutton-barto-textbook].
